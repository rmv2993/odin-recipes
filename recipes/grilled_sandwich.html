    <h3>Preparation steps</h3>
    <div>
     
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare your grill for medium direct heat. (Approximately 350 degrees)</li>
        <li>Use a meat tenderizer/mallet and pound the chicken until it is even in thickness and about ½-¾ inch thick. If you are using large chicken breasts, you should be able to cut them in half. Use your bun as a sizing guide.</li>
        <li>Brush the chicken breasts with oil and season with salt, pepper and italian seasoning on both sides.</li>
        <li>Place on the preheated grill and cook for about 8-10 minutes, turning once halfway through cooking. Check for doneness and continue cooking until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the grill and place the mozzarella on top.</li>
        <li>Prepare each bottom half of the bun with mayonnaise, lettuce and tomato then top with the chicken and bun.</li>
